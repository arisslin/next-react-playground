# Introduction

This project is for me to play around with some web dev technologies combined
with nextjs and react.

Because i use this as playground i don't write tests for every piece of code.

# Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see
the result.

# Technologies

- react
- next.js
- tailwind.css
